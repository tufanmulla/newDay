# New Day Travel - Savor The Travel Moment - Learning Project

Welcome to the New Day Travel project, a single-page website designed for educational purposes to practice HTML and CSS.

## Description

This project is a single-page website related to a travel agency. It is not a professional website but rather a learning exercise to implement HTML and CSS skills. Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in building responsive web designs using media queries. This allowed me to ensure that the website looks and functions well on various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.
